## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
gss_cat
gss_cat %>% count(race)
p <-ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race))
p + geom_bar()
p + geom_bar() + scale_x_discrete(drop=FALSE)
relig_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by (relig) %>%
  summarise( 
    age = mean (age, na.rm = TRUE),
    tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm=TRUE),
    n=n()
    )
ggplot(relig_summary, aes(tvhours, relig)) + geom_point()

# the factor
# the numeric vector you want to use to reorder the levels 
 ggplot (relig_summary, aes(tvhours, fct_reorder(relig,tvhours))) + geom_point()
 
 # use mutate to make the data easier to handle
 relig_summary %>%
   mutate (relig = fct_reorder(relig,tvhours)) %>% ggplot(aes(tvhours, relig)) + geom_point()  ## reorder the category
 
 # this plot shows how average age varies across reported in come level
 rincome_summary <- gss_cat %>%
   group_by(rincome) %>%
   summarise(
     age = mean(age, na.rm=),
     tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE),
     n = n()
   )
 ggplot(rincome_summary,aes(age, fct_reorder(rincome, age))) + 
   geom_point()
 
 ggplot(rincome_summary, aes(age, rincome)) + geom_point()

   group_by(age,marital) %>%
   count() %>%
   mutate (prop = n/ sum(n))
 
 ggplot(by_age,aes(age,prop, colour = marital)) + geom_line(na.rm = TRUE)
```
# modifying facotr levels
```{r}

## remember you are meking plots for people
