## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Strings {.smaller}
```{r}
str_length("abc")
x <- c("abcdef","ghifjk")
# The 3rd letter
str_sub(x,3,3)

# The 2nd to 2nd-to-last character
str_sub(x,2,-2)

str_sub(x,3,3) <-x
x

# duplicate individual strings
str_dup(x,c(2,3))

# matches any character (except a newline)
x <- c("apple","beans", "pe.ar", "banana")
str_view(x, ".e.")
str_view(x, "e//.a")
```

## Extract
```{r}
colors <- c("blue","orange","yellow")
color_match <- str_c(colors,collapse = "|")
color_match
has_color <- str_subset (sentences, color_match)
matches <- str_extract (has_color, color_match)
head(matches)
```

## Exact match 
str_extract() gives us the complete match
str_match() gives each individual component

```{r}
noun <- "(a|the)([^ ] +)"
has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(nount)%>%
  head(10)
found <- has_noun %>%
  str_extract(noun)
```
